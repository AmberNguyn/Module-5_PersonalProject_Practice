state = initial state
action = what you do to the state (like increment the state)
reducer = do what action tells it to do (state+1)
slide = state + actions + reducer

redux toolkit = you introduce state+action+reducer all in one place (that is slide/createSlice)

name -> easier to distinguish between store

you do everything (state, action, reducer) in slice -> after you finish, make sure you add the reducer to store
